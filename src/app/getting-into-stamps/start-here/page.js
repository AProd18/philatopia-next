          What is Stamp Collecting?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Stamp collecting</strong> is the hobby of gathering postage
          stamps and related postal items, often for enjoyment, education, or
          investment. It involves finding, organizing, and preserving stamps
          from various countries and time periods.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong>Philately</strong>, on the other hand, is the study of postage
          stamps, their history, production, and cultural context. While many
          stamp collectors are philatelists, philately goes beyond just
          collecting — it explores the deeper stories and technical aspects
          behind the stamps.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Philatelists often collect stamps based on specific <em>themes</em>{" "}
          (like birds, space, or sports), <em>countries</em>,{" "}
          <em>historical periods</em>, or even <em>printing errors</em> and rare
          editions. Some collectors focus on <strong>postmarks</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>envelopes (known as covers)</strong>, or full sets issued
          during specific events.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The hobby began shortly after the release of the world&apos;s first
          postage stamp — the <strong>Penny Black</strong> — issued in{" "}
          <strong>1840</strong> in Great Britain. It featured Queen Victoria and
          revolutionized communication. The first known stamp collector was{" "}
          <strong>John Edward Gray</strong>, a British zoologist who began
          saving stamps in <strong>1841</strong>.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-12">
          Since then, stamp collecting has evolved into a global hobby with
          millions of enthusiasts. It combines history, geography, design, and
          storytelling — all through tiny, fascinating windows into the past and
          present.
        </p>

          Why Start Collecting Stamps?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Stamp collecting is more than just a pastime — it&apos;s a mindful,
          enriching activity that allows you to slow down and appreciate the
          details. Whether you&apos;re young or old, it offers a peaceful escape
          from fast-paced routines while still engaging your curiosity and
          intellect.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Through stamps, you explore different <strong>countries</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>cultures</strong>, <strong>historical events</strong>, and{" "}
          <strong>notable individuals</strong>. Each stamp tells a story,
          offering insight into the world from unique perspectives.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-4">
          They are miniature works of art — often intricately designed and
          historically significant. Collecting them can spark an interest in
          art, history, geography, or design.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-4">
          One of the joys of stamp collecting is the ability to create a
          collection that&apos;s entirely your own. You might focus on themes
          that resonate with your personal passions — from wildlife and
          architecture to space exploration or royal history.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-12">
          Perhaps most importantly, stamp collecting connects you to a global
          community. Whether through clubs, exhibitions, or online forums,
          you&apos;ll find others who share your interest and enthusiasm.
          It&apos;s a hobby that grows with you — offering lifelong learning and
          lasting enjoyment.

          How to Begin
        </h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-12 text-md leading-relaxed space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Start simple:</strong> Begin by saving stamps from letters
            and packages you receive at home. Ask family and friends to save
            theirs for you too.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose a theme or focus:</strong> Animals, space
            exploration, famous leaders, historical events, or stamps from your
            own country are all great starting points.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gather basic tools:</strong> Invest in a stamp album or
            stock book, stamp tongs (tweezers), a magnifying glass, and possibly
            a perforation gauge. These tools help you organize and safely handle
            your stamps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Join a community:</strong> Look for local stamp clubs or
            join online forums like Reddit&apos;s r/philately, Stamp Community
            Forum, or even Facebook groups. You&apos;ll learn faster by
            connecting with others.
